\subsection*{Instruction Set Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Instruction set architecture (ISA):} Defines the interface between hardware and software.
    \item RISC-V instructions are 32-bits (instruction[31:0]).
    \item RISC-V assembly uses 64-bit registers (double word) and 32-bit word registers.
    \item There are 32 registers (x0-x31), with x0 always being zero.
    \item Arithmetic operations require data to be in registers.
    \item "Less frequently used" variables are "spilled" into memory.
    \item Registers are faster and more energy-efficient than memory.
    \item RISC-V has a 16-bit instruction set (RISC-V compressed) for embedded applications with code size constraints.
    \item Memory is byte-addressable with little-endian byte ordering.
    \item RISC-V uses a Harvard architecture with separate instruction and data caches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Instruction Formats}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{R-type instructions:} Use three register operands (2 sources and 1 destination).
    \item \textbf{I-type instructions:} Use two register operands and a 12-bit immediate value.
    \item \textbf{S-type instructions:} Use two register operands and a 12-bit immediate value for stores.
    \item \textbf{SB-type instructions:} Conditional branch instructions with PC-relative addressing.
    \item \textbf{U-type instructions:} Upper immediate format for adding an immediate value to PC.
    \item \textbf{UJ-type instructions:} Unconditional jump instructions for jumps and links.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
    \item R-type instruction example: \texttt{add x5,x6,x2} is coded as \texttt{0000000 00010 00110 000 00101 0110011}.
    \item I-type instruction example: \texttt{ld x9, 64(x22)} is coded as \texttt{0000 0100 0000 10110 011 01001 0000011}.
    \item S-type instruction example: \texttt{sd x9, 240(x10)} is coded as \texttt{0000111 01001 01010 011 10000 0100011}.
    \item SB-type instruction example: \texttt{bne x10, x11, 2000} is coded as \texttt{1100000 01011 01010 001 11110 1100011}.
    \item U-type instruction example: \texttt{auipc x1, 1000} is coded as \texttt{0000000 10001 00000 11011 0010111}.
    \item UJ-type instruction example: \texttt{jal x11, 2000} is coded as \texttt{1000000 01011 00000 11011 1101111}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Code Examples}

\subsection*{Compilers and Branches}
Compilers frequently create branches and labels where they do not appear in the programming language.

\subsection*{RISC-V Logical Operations}
RISC-V logical operations include shift left/right, right arithmetic, bitwise AND/OR/NOT/XOR.

\subsubsection{Example 1}
\begin{verbatim}
if (i == j)
    f = g + h;
else
    f = g - h;

assume f through j correspond to values in registers x19 through x23

bne x22, x23, Else  // go to Else if i != j
add x19, x20, x21  // f = g + h
beq x0, x0, Exit   // go to Exit

Else: sub x19, x20, x21  // f = g - h

Exit:
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Example 2}
\begin{verbatim}
while (save[i] == k)
    i += 1;

assume value of i is in register x22 and value of k is in register x24.
Assume the base of array save[] is in x25.

loop: slli x10, x22, 3      // x10 = i * 8
       add x10, x10, x25    // x10 now has the address of save[]
       ld x9, 0(x10)        // load save[i] into x9
       bne x9, x24, Exit    // if save[i] != k go to exit
       addi x22, x22, 1     // i++
       beq x0, x0, Loop     // go to loop

Exit:
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Procedures}
Procedures allow programmers to concentrate on just one portion of the task at a time.

\subsubsection{Procedure Instructions}
By convention in RISC-V:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 8 parameter registers x10-x17 are used to pass parameters or return values.
    \item One return address register x1 holds the return address to return to the point of origin.
\end{itemize}

In RISC-V, there are special procedure instructions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Jump and link instruction (jal):} For procedures, which branches to an address and saves the address of the following instruction (PC+4) to rd=x1.
\end{itemize}

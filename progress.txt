Progress Updates
Day 1: Monday 22nd May 2023
• Completed setup and installation of all dependencies of the project (Python 3.11, pip, MAVLink, mavgenerate.py, pymavlink, mavutil)
• Have the Raspberry Pi 3 software setup and ready to go
• Update the project progress on GitHub for future reference: https://github.com/sabdulmajid/mavlink
• Have learnt how to setup a connection, wait for heartbeats, and send & receive messages using a UDP port
• Have learnt how to use MAVLink to sign messages and verify signatures
• Have added new examples to the ReadME file on GitHub for future reference

Day 2: Tuesday 23rd May 2023
• Have learnt how to use MAVLink to encrypt messages and decrypt messages
• Added new examples to the MAVLink ReadME file on GitHub for future reference
• Added integration guide for MAVLink, Raspberry Pi 3, and Pixhawk 4 on GitHub for future reference
• Installed MAVProxy dependencies on Mac
• Ensured that the Pixhawk 4 is compatible with MAVLink protocol v2.0
• Added useful messages for drone communication development
• Added access to Android app to find vitals of drone
• Added MAVLink components for future drone development
• Added common protocols for UAV development
• Added extra information about features not added to the main MAVLink protocol library (so we can be aware of them and work around them)
• Installed the dronekit-sitl Python library
• Added code snippets which will help complete my two tasks

Day 3: Wednesday 24th May 2023
• Have installed all dependencies that were giving errors last time (MAVProxy, wxPython, and attrdict3) [took most of my morning today :( ]
• Created quick-start manual on GitHub for instructions to setup & start the project
• Researched on how to integrate all this separate tools together to create a working prototype
• Documented my research in the GitHub ReadME page
• Have fully set-up the Raspberry Pi 3, including SSH
• Have downloaded all the required dependencies both on the iMac and the Raspberry Pi 3
• Main task for tommorow is to connect up the dronekit-sitl to the Pixhawk and start writing code for it (in a simulated environment)

Day 4: Thursday 25th May 2023
• Have successfully connected the dronekit-sitl to the Pixhawk 4 (in a simulation environment)
• Updated the software on the drone's Raspberry Pi 4
• Ran into multiple issues regarding Python 2 and Python 3 collisions in the RasbianOS, which I managed to fix
• Had to fully rewire the pip on the RP4 because there was an outdated, deprecated version of it pre-installed
• Communicated with Hussain to resolve any software issues he was facing on the RP4
• Researched about connecting the physical drone to the software on the Raspberry Pi 4
• Looked into adding a different camera module to the drone (found out 6 different types)
• Researched about potential issues that may arise when connecting the drone to the software on the Raspberry Pi 4
• Discussed about QGroundControl and Mission Planner with Hussain

Day 5: Sunday 28th May 2023
• Reseached about QGroundControl and how to connnect a drone to it
• Have connected drone to MAVProxy from dronekit-sitl
• Have installed VirtualBox and have researched on how to use it
• Installed Ubuntu 22.04 on the iMac, to smoothly use a dual boot to connect to Mission Planner
• Ran into a bunch of issues regarding the installation and the optimized functionality of Ubuntu 22.04
• Have successfully managed to install all dependencies needed for the project
• Used MONO on Linux to install the Mission Planner software

Day 6: Monday 29th May 2023
• Succesfully found the issue for the Virtual Machine problem, and uninstalled the VirtualBox software and used VMWare Fusion instead
• Have successfully installed Ubuntu 22.04 on the iMac Virtual Machine
• Have successfully installed Mission Planner on the Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine
• Have successfully connected the simulation to dronekit-sitl
• Have to research into how to use the Mission Planner software, and run simulations
• Took the drone out for a manual test flight, to test functionality and to see if it is working properly
• Have successfully connected the drone to the Mission Planner software
• Running into problems trying to run the Mission Planner on the Linux Virtual Machine - such as rendering issues, programming issues, and connection issues
• Might have to migrate to another different system for better simulation control over a drone

Day 7: Tuesday 30th May 2023
• Fixed up the issues I had with the Linux Virtual Machine
• Discovered that pymavlink is incompatibile with Python 3.11, 3.10, 3.7 and even 3.6, and would not install on the Linux Virtual Machine
• Had to downgrade each time from 3.11 to 3.10 to 3.7 and finall 3.6 to install pymavlink, before giving up
